\f0\fs24 \cf0 So it took me watching the videos a couple of times to grasp what hashing and salting are. As I started searching for words, I will admit I had a lot of fun testing it out. It\'92s so funny to see how much the internet has changed. When AOL first came out, we were able to use passwords as simple as \'91password123\'92, or \'91angel\'92. Now-a-days when you create a userId and password, there\'92s always requirements, such as 8 characters long, 1 upper case letter, 1 number,  plus we also get the privilege to have a small bar that tells you if you have a  \'91weak\'92, \'91moderate\'92, or \'91strong\'92 password. It blew my mind to see how simple and quick it was to crack hash passwords. I didn\'92t have any luck with the salted passwords but that\'92s also assuming I did it correctly :)  \

 One question for everyone, do you know where I can find more tutorials on this? I looked at other Lynda.com videos but I\'92d like to see more coding visuals on it. }
